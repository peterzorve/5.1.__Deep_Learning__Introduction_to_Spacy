saudi arabia has suffered a string of deadly shootings and bomb attacks in recent months many of which the daesh (socalled is) terrorist organization have claimed responsibility for in july suicide bombers struck three cities across saudi arabia killing at least four security officers the apparently coordinated attacks came on the penultimate day of the muslim holy month of ramadan recently the ministry of interior foiled a planned suicide attack on a mosque in the qatif region in eastern saudi arabia on aug 24 indeed the ministry of interior has successfully repelled hundreds of terrorist operations since 2003 displaying security expertise that is admired worldwide many countries have benefited from this experience in counter terrorism however success at security level does not correspond to a counter terrorist ideology that has seeped into our communities through social media or by any other means

the discourse and ideology of any terrorist organization be it alqaeda daesh or any other is almost identical regardless of the form it takes or the time in which it exists this discourse is characterized in three ways

firstly it is dogmatic identified by intolerance and rejection of any idea of ‘the other’ dogmatic personalities refuse to enter into discussion even if their ideas are proved to be faulty as they think their own ideas are prescribed by god and thus have the overtones of holiness which makes them categorically incontestable as ‘the absolute truth’ hence this is an advanced case of intellectual recession and the absence of scientific critique

secondly it is utopian evoking concepts of ‘ideal city’ similar to ‘caliphate state’ or ‘rightly guided caliphate’ forms a cultural and religious component of the arab and islamic mindset ever since the fall of the ottoman empire ‘restoration of the islamic caliphate’ has been behind the emergence of many hardline islamic organizations these organizations claim that they deserve to raise the flag of the islamic caliphate governed by a single caliph who rules muslims in the east and in the west abolishing all positive ‘nation states’ set out according to the sykespicot agreement hardline islamic organizations include the muslim brotherhood in egypt the gulen movement in turkey jamaateislami in india alqaeda and daesh

thirdly it is dystopian it rejects contemporary reality as it perceives all communities as ignorant and all regimes as infidels governed by tyrants who impose laws that have nothing to do with religion in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks alqaeda raised the banner of excommunication of communities regimes and scholars this organization caused damage to many countries especially saudi arabia however the power of the saudi state security system eliminated alqaeda dramatically undermined its capabilities and forced it to retreat to yemen where a political and institutional vacuum prevails today daesh is adopting the same discourse by escalating excommunication terrorism and violence which seem to be interconnected

it is necessary to deconstruct terrorist discourse refute its suspicions at an intellectual level and clarify their deviated citation of religious texts to promote their ideology official and nonofficial religious institutions must take the responsibility for refuting such suspicions by various means and on all platforms they must also take the responsibility for working on the establishment of moderate centric thought it is also necessary to contain the youth through modern religious discourse to correct misconceptions of restoring a utopian islamic caliphate and promote national pertinence in education the media and social media there are ongoing efforts worthy of mention that are working well in deconstructing such a discourse including the mohammad bin naif counseling and care centre the assakina campaign for dialogue the hedaya centre and the sawab centre in the uae however all gulf arab and even international efforts must be concerted to counter terrorism as it is a job that has to be undertaken collectively because terrorism represents a renewed international threat that recognizes no place religion nationality color or ethnicity
